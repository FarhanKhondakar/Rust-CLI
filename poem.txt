Silent Whispers

In the hush of twilight's breath,
Where shadows dance and whispers wreathe,
Echoes of forgotten dreams,
Softly tread where moonlight gleams.

Through the silence, a tale unfolds,
Of secrets kept and stories untold,
In the quiet, where hearts entwine,
A fleeting moment, yours and mine.
